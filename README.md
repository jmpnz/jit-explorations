# jit-explorations

Mostly small stuff written while learning more about JITs.

Most of the code is designed to build x86-64 ELF binaries with some code
for AArch64 for Apple Silicon.

To run the x86-64 ELF binaries we use [Blink](https://github.com/jart/blink).

A build and assembly script is provided in `assemble-x86.sh`.
